  body: When <tt>should</tt> is called with no explicit receiver, the call is delegated
    to the <b>subject</b> of the example group. This could be either an explicit subject
    generated by calling the block passed to +ExampleGroupMethods#subject+, or, if
    the group is describing a class, an implicitly generated instance of that class.
